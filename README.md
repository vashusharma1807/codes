# codes
A repository containing codes along with commented step-by-step explanation from leetcode.
I will update it everyday with atleast 10 new questions. If time permits, will add even more.
If you need a specific question's solution with explanations, mail me.

I have tried to give the most efficient algorithm in terms of space and time complexity.
I have solved each and every question from Leetcode, even those included in the premium subscription.

Feel free to suggest any edits.
